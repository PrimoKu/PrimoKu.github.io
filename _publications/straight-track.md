excerpt: "In this paper, we introduce StraightTrack, a mixed reality (MR) system developed to assist in orthopedic guiding wire placement and prevent K-wire bending in complex anatomical regions. The system incorporates a rigid access cannula with an integrated marker body to minimize bending caused by contact with soft tissue or bone. Leveraging an OST HMD with on-device optical tracking, StraightTrack provides real-time surgical guidance while addressing spatial navigation challenges and reducing entry point perception errors.<br/><img src='/images/500x300.png' style='padding: 30px 0;'>"
