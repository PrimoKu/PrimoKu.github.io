title: "StraightTrack: Towards Mixed Reality Navigation System for Percutaneous K-wire Insertion"
collection: publications
category: # Type
permalink: /publication/straight-track
excerpt: "In this paper, we introduce StraightTrack, a mixed reality (MR) system developed to assist in orthopedic guiding wire placement and prevent K-wire bending in complex anatomical regions. The system incorporates a rigid access cannula with an integrated marker body to minimize bending caused by contact with soft tissue or bone. Leveraging an OST HMD with on-device optical tracking, StraightTrack provides real-time surgical guidance while addressing spatial navigation challenges and reducing entry point perception errors.<br/>
