excerpt: "In this work, we explore how different visualization techniques for guiding attention toward objects outside a user's field of view impact responsiveness and cognitive workload in MR environments. We examine three visualization paradigms through a user study involving 24 participants. By analyzing Just Noticeable Differences (JNDs) and assessing mental load with the NASA Task Load Index, we aim to determine which technique best balances user perception and cognitive effort. <br/><img src='/images/evaluate-JND.png' style='padding: 30px 0;'>"

In this work, we explore how different visualization techniques for guiding attention toward objects outside a user's field of view impact responsiveness and cognitive workload in MR environments. We examine three visualization paradigms through a user study involving 24 participants. By analyzing Just Noticeable Differences (JNDs) and assessing mental load with the NASA Task Load Index, we aim to determine which technique best balances user perception and cognitive effort.
