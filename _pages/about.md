I am a Robotics Master's student at Johns Hopkins University. I am passionate about leveraging emerging technologies like mixed reality and digital twins to advance healthcare, particularly in interventional procedures. My work focuses on integrating computer-assisted systems with mixed reality environments to enhance surgical precision and efficiency. Currently, my research includes room-scale digital twin simulation for synthetic data generation and developing high-fidelity virtual reality system for clinical training, involving the reconstruction of object-level 3D digital twins and the creation of photorealistic datasets to enhance surgical phase detection algorithms.

I am a member of the Advanced Robotics and Computationally Augmented Environments ([ARCADE](https://arcade.cs.jhu.edu)) research group, led by [Mathias Unberath](https://mathiasunberath.github.io). In 2020, I earned a B.A. in Mechatronics Engineering from the National Taiwan Normal University.
