title: "Augmented Reality-Enhanced Surgical Microscopes for Spinal Procedures"
excerpt: "This project introduces an augmented reality-enhanced surgical microscope system to improve precision and reduce radiation exposure during Minimally Invasive Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (MIS TLIF). By overlaying preoperative 3D models onto the surgeon’s real-time view, it enhances visualization of critical areas like Kambin’s triangle, enabling safer navigation and more accurate instrument placement. <br/><img src='/images/ar-spine.png' style='padding: 30px 0 0 0;'>"
